Roman Numeral Builder
Given an integer, return its equivalent value in Roman numerals.

Roman numerals use these symbols:

Symbol	Value
I	1
V	5
X	10
L	50
C	100
D	500
M	1000
Roman numerals are written from largest to smallest, left to right using the following rules:

Addition is used when a symbol is followed by one of equal or smaller value. For example, 18 is written as XVIII (10 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 18).
Subtraction is used when a smaller symbol appears before a larger one, to represent 4 or 9 in any place value. For example, 19 is written as XIX (10 + (10 - 1)).
No symbol may be repeated more than three times in a row. Subtraction is used when you would otherwise need to write a symbol more than three times in a row. So the largest number you can write is 3999.
Here's one more example: given 1464, return "MCDLXIV" (1000 + (500 - 100) + 50 + 10 + (5 - 1)).
